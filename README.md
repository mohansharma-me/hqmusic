Entertainment website for downloading bollywood songs.

This website i developed while working at WebcodeZ Infoway. Basically idea behind creating such free music sharing website is to attract free traffic for digital marketing.

Website features search facility, two different qualities, album management and one specific technical requirement is, when administrator upload new album with mp3 audio files, every audio files get processed for watermarking, tag editing works and then converting it in two different versions, barcode generation.
